# CookItUp
# PURPOSE OF THE APP
People could discover new food that they would never see in a restaurant or that would never be cooked by a chef. It is a fun way of discovering the amazing world of cooking. You might think that this is not for you, but the recipes are very well described… Don't be shy, don’t be scared to fail and join us. CookItUp! is here for you.
# GENERAL DESCRIPTION
CookItUp! is a cooking app where users can share recipes. Users select a certain recipe and the app returns precise instructions on how to cook it. It is a cooperative app because users are the ones who share their own recipes so others can try them. If you cook someone else’s recipe you could post a picture of your results and the ones with the most likes will be on top.

There is a fridge feature in which you may indicate each ingredient that you have in your house. This will allow you to filter through the recipes and look for the ones that you can make exclusively with the ingredients at your disposal. The fridge automatically discards those ingredients already used and it adds those that you have bought.
## SOME IMPORTANT ASPECTS

The system of rewards consists of getting prizes depending on the use you have and the people that have done or liked your recipes. When you reach a certain quantity of game coins, you can buy discounts on different products such as cooking tools, food, or even getting a sponsorship with some enterprises that work with us.

Our internal ranking system depends on the likes you have, we have two rankings, the first ranking relates to recipes, the more likes you have the higher in the list it appears. Inside each recipe, each person that has cooked that dish upload a photo to demonstrate that they have done it. Once you have uploaded your photo you will get the reward. In this way everybody will be able to see the best and  worst dishes and decide if they want to start that adventure.
# RISKS
We have to make sure that the photo that has been uploaded is related to the recipe and is not taken from the internet. In order to check it, there is an available report option where users can vote. If a certain photo has a large number of reports it will be deleted.
The web stores users and their passwords. These must be kept safely.
