#INTRODUCTION

From the management team we have reached some conclusions. In our project all of us have a similar knowlegde of everything, and we have to deal with this limitations
in order to achieve our goals. For that purpose we have divided the team into several groups, with different responsabilities:

- Planning team: Lucía Gutiérrez (management leader), Lucía Corpas
- Quality team: Lucía Gutiérrez, Guillermo Pérez-Peña
- Modeling team: Inbal Hasson (technical leader), Jorge Velázquez
- Design team: Inbal Hasson, Jorge Velázquez
- Testing team: Lucía Corpas, Guillermo Pérez-Peña, Javier Zafra
- Requirement team: Javier Jordán, Javier Zafra, Alfonso Martínez
- Risks team: Javier Jordán, Alfonso Martínez
- Programmer team: all of us

As we are very inexperienced in this kind of work, we have decided that the best planning strategy is the agile method, beacuse it provide a great reaction to the changes
it may happen during the development of the project.
